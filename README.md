# Introduction 

## 1. Background of BlockEmulator


Initiated by **[HuangLab](http://xintelligence.pro/)**  (a research group in the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China), ***BlockEmulator** is a blockchain testbed that enables researchers to verify their proposed new protocols and mechanisms. It supports multiple consensus protocols, particularly the blockchain sharding mechanism.


The main purpose of this testbed is to help users (researchers, students, etc.) quickly verify their own blockchain consensus protocols and blockchain-sharding protocols. 

**BlockEmulator** is designed as an experimental platform that adopts a lightweight system architecture. It simplifies the implementation of industrial-class blockchains since **BlockEmulator** only implements the core functions of a blockchain, including the transaction pool, block packaging, consensus protocols, and on-chain transaction storage. It also supports common consensus protocols, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).

In particular, BlockEmulator offers the system-level design and implementation for blockchain-sharding mechanisms. For example, the cross-shard transaction mechanisms implemented by BlockEmulator include the following two representative solutions: i) **Relay transaction mechanism** proposed by **Monoxide** (NSDI'2019), and ii) the **BrokerChain** protocol (INFOCOM'2022) [PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356789473_BrokerChain_A_Cross-Shard_Blockchain_Protocol_for_AccountBalance-based_State_Sharding).

BlockEmulator is oriented toward blockchain researchers. It provides a blockchain experimental platform for quickly implementing their own algorithms, protocols, and mechanisms. It also offers very helpful functions to help researchers collect experimental data, facilitating their plotting experimental figures.

## 4. Highlights of BlockEmulator

1. **Lightweight**. BlockEmulator is a lightweight testbed platform for blockchain experiments.
2. **Fast Configuration**. BlockEmulator enables users to set up their environments quickly and supports remote deployment on the Cloud.
3. **Customization**. BlockEmulator is implemented using the GoLand language, which supports users' customization and modification.
4. **Easy to Conduct Experiments**. BlockEmulator supports the replay of historical transactions of mainstream blockchains (such as Ethereum). It can automatically yield experimental log files. Using those log files, researchers can interpret plenty of metrics such as system throughput, confirmation latency of transactions, the queueing of the transaction pool, etc. This function is very useful for researchers and students to facilitate their experimental data collection and plotting of experimental charts.
